      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The end is near (for the development of this website)! Almost
            certainly at least, on the client-facing end. I've just migrated the 
            website onto Bootstrap 4, from B3, and made the pages more 
            responsive.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not 4K friendly, and I don't have any plans to make it so, at 
            this moment.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All that's left, at this point, is to do a re-styling of the
            website. Beyond that, it's all refactoring on the backend which - 
            if everything goes to plan - should not impact your experience at
            all.

      <ul>

          <p>
            So good news and bad news. On one hand, we now have a whole load of 
            camps! With comment and users and everything!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            On the other hand, I removed everything from the DB. Which includes your
            accounts as well. :////
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            So I humbly ask you to remake your accounts, and forgive me for my sins.

            Major Update! Due to a major redesign of the underlying database
            schema, I've had to remove all the comments, campgrounds and
            notifications. Your account is still there though!
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have now added pages to the page that shows all the camps! You 
            won't be able to see it currently, as there aren't enough camps to
            activate the feature, but if there are more than 9, you'll be able
            to see it. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A later update will add more camps.</p>

            Ratings have been implemented! Now you can rate camps, and their
            ratings are shown on the main campgrounds page, and also the 
            campgrounds own page.

            Existing users should not need to activate their accounts, but if
