      <ul>
        <li>So good news and bad news. On one hand, we now have a whole load of 
          camps! With comment and users and everything!
        </li>
        <li>On the other hand, I removed everything from the DB. Which includes your
          accounts as well. :////
        </li>
        <li>
          So I humbly ask you to remake your accounts, and forgive me for my sins.

      <ul>
        <li>Major Update! Due to a major redesign of the underlying database
          schema, I've had to remove all the comments, campgrounds and
          notifications. Your account is still there though!
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We have now added pages to the page that shows all the camps! You 
            won't be able to see it currently, as there aren't enough camps to
            activate the feature, but if there are more than 9, you'll be able
            to see it. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A later update will add more camps.</p>
