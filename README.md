# YelpCamp

A little project app to brush up my NodeJS skills. It basically acts as a review site for campgrounds. "Yelp for camps", as it were.

It was made following [Colt Steeles "The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) on Udemy. Almost all functionality was written following his course, though some changes had to be made. These were either because the lecture's code was depreciated, or because a service he was using moved on.

Any features that are implemented outside of the course are in _italics_.
